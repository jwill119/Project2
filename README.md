## Project organization

We will have headers and cpp files for each of several options:

- hash.h/hash.cpp
    * These define the hash operations, different whether or not there are children
- node.h/node.cpp
    * These define the data structure making up the nodes of our tracking tree
- trackingtree.h/trackingtree.cpp
    * These define the operations on our tracking tree: construction, editing, etc.
- driver.cpp
    * The main file
