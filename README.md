## Project organization

We will have headers and cpp files for each of several options:

- hash.h/hash.cpp
    * These define the hash operations, different whether or not there are children
- node.h/node.cpp
    * These define the data structure making up the nodes of our tracking tree
- trackingtree.h/trackingtree.cpp
    * These define the operations on our tracking tree: construction, editing, etc.
    *!!C.A. add something I'm not super happy with any of it but if you want keep it that is fine 
    maybe clean up some of it. I will try to to clean/add more later !! 
- driver.cpp
    * The main file
